## Example
![sample.png](readmeAssets%2Fsample.png)

You can add items by typing in the input field and pressing the `Add` button.\
You can also delete items by pressing the `Delete` button.
- This program only supports one user.
- The data isn't saved after the server is closed.
    - Honestly, test case failed.
- So every time you enter the site, the data is reset.
